# Band-Gap-Simulation-Doping Effect
In this project, the effect of n-type and p-type doping types on the energy band structure of a semiconductor is modeled graphically.
## Used Tools
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
  
##Explanation
Taking the valence and conduction bands constant, the change in Fermi levels for intrinsic, n-type and p-type doping states is visualized.
